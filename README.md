# Call Center Data Analysis

## Problem Statement
The customer service call center is experiencing high **Average Handling Time (AHT)** and increasing **customer dissatisfaction**. A significant number of calls are related to specific issues like **IRROPS** and **Voluntary Changes**, emphasizing the need for optimized **IVR systems**. Repetitive queries increase agent workload, calling for **self-service options** to reduce pressure. Additionally, **silence periods** and difficulty identifying **customer dissatisfaction** early in the calls suggest the need for improved **agent communication strategies**. 

This project analyzes call data to derive insights aimed at improving **operational efficiency** and **customer satisfaction**.

## Key Objectives
- **Identify Key Drivers** for long AHT and Average Speed to Answer (AST).
- **Analyze Call Reasons and Sentiments**: Extract recurring problems to be solved via IVR systems and reduce escalations.
- **Predict Primary Call Reasons** for calls in the test dataset.

## Tools and Technologies
- **Python** (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, etc.)
- **Jupyter Notebooks**
- **Matplotlib/Seaborn** for Data Visualization
- **Machine Learning Models** (Random Forest Classifier)

## Setup and Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/repo-name.git
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## How to Run
- Run the Jupyter notebook and Python scripts for data analysis and modeling.
- Use the test dataset to validate predictions for primary call reasons.

## Results
- Summary of findings on **key drivers** of long AHT and AST.
- Analysis of **recurring call reasons** and recommendations for IVR optimizations.
- Predictions for **primary call reasons**.
